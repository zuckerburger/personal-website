            One of my favourite hobbies is playing electric guitar (who would've thought) and I've been playing for almost a decade.
            My favourite guitarists are Gary Moore, David Gilmour (Pink Floyd), and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).

            My other hobbies include weightlifting, playing video games, bouldering,

            My personal portfolio started with The Odin Project, where I learned how to build a lot of basic full-stack web apps.
            Calculators, to do lists, message boards, etc. Combined with 1531, I learned how to build basic frontends, deploy backends,
            connect databases, and I got the confidence to start projects on my own.

        <div class="sub-content">
            Web-Plate was the first full-stack app that I built from scratch. Inspired by the software I use at the restaurant I work at,
            I designed a web app that lets users customise menus, create orders, and view sales summaries.
            I used Express, EJS, PostgreSQL, and Render.

            Orchid was a full-stack app that I helped develop for the DevSoc Game Jam.
            Thanks to the Odin Project and Web-Plate, I was the most experienced at developing web apps in our group,
            so I helped lead most of the development, and assisted with both the frontend and backend.
            Orchid was a multiplayer flashcard game to help students study, complete with leaderboards, streaks, and badges.
            We were very happy to achieve 2nd place, considering that we had only met 2 days prior.

            If I were being completely honest with myself, my true dream is becoming a world famous guitarist.

            My love for programming began at the age of 10, with Scratch.
            Some of my friends introduced it to me, and I was soon obsessed.
            After endless tutorials, and probably an unethical amount of plagiarism,
            I managed to build a 2d platformer.

            At 14, I wanted to try something new and build a game in Roblox. I was completely lost.
            <br>
            Gone were the days of dragging and dropping blocks, I had to write code in Lua now.
            It took me months of grinding, but I managed to build some really simple games.
            <br>
            The feeling of satisfaction after making a game and getting to play it with my friends was unparalleled.
            At this point I realised this could be a great career path.
        </div>
        <div class="sub-content">
            I went on to build more games over the following years, and by the time I was 16 I was a "freelancer".
            The pay was downright criminal, but it felt awesome to actually make money off my skills.

        <div class="sub-content">
            When I got to uni it was a whole different ball game.
            I expected to cruise through comp1511 from all my previous experience.
            But I soon realised how little I understood about how you're actually meant to code.
            That being said, I've really enjoyed every step,
            and it's been awesome to work on so many different technologies.
