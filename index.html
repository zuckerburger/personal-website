            One of my favourite hobbies is playing electric guitar (who would've thought) and I've been playing for almost a decade.
            My favourite guitarists are Gary Moore, John Mayer, and David Gilmour.

            My personal portfolio started with The Odin Project, where I learned how to build a lot of basic full-stack web apps.
            Calculators, to do lists, message boards, etc. Combined with 1531, I learned how to build basic frontends, deploy backends,
            connect databases, and I got the confidence to start projects on my own.

            Web-Plate was the first full-stack app that I built from scratch. Inspired by the software I use at the restaurant I work at,
            I designed a web app that lets users customise menus, create orders, and view sales summaries.
            I used Express, EJS, PostgreSQL, and Render.

            Orchid was a full-stack app that I helped develop for the DevSoc Game Jam.
            Thanks to the Odin Project and Web-Plate, I was the most experienced at developing web apps in our group,
            so I helped lead most of the development, and assisted with both the frontend and backend.
            Orchid was a multiplayer flashcard game to help students study, complete with leaderboards, streaks, and badges.
            We were very happy to achieve 2nd place, considering that we had only met 2 days prior.

            If I were being completely honest with myself, my true dream would be to become a world famous guitarist.
            That being said, software engineering is a close second.

            My love for programming began at the age of 10, with Scratch.
            Some of my friends were also messing around with it and having fun, but I was obsessed.
            After endless tutorials, and probably an unethical amount of plagiarism,
            I managed to build a 2d platformer, 'Where's My Body'.
            It wasn't exactly AAA standard, it was a stick figure head that rolled around,
            but I managed to implement some pretty cool features like portals.

            Once I was 14, I wanted to try something new, and build a game in Roblox. I felt completely lost.
            Gone were the days of dragging and dropping blocks, I had to write code in Lua now.
            It took me months of grinding, but I managed to build some really simple games.
            The feeling of satisfaction after building a game and getting to play it with my friends was unparalleled.
            For a moment, I was completely convinced this was something I wanted to do.
            I went on to build more games over the following years, and by the time I was 16 I was a freelancer.
            The pay was downright criminal, and a lot of people flaked, but it felt awesome to actually make money off my skills.

            When I got to uni it was a whole different ball game.
            I expected to cruise through comp1511 from all my previous experience.
            But I soon realised how little I understood about how you're actually meant to code.
            That being said, I've really enjoyed every step,
            and it's been awesome to work on so many different technologies.
